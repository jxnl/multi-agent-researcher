# Multi-Agent Research System Implementation

This implementation demonstrates a multi-agent research system inspired by Anthropic's architecture, using Instructor for structured LLM outputs.

## Key Components Built

### 1. **Core Agent Architecture** (`src/researcher/agents/base.py`)
- Abstract `Agent` base class with planning and execution phases
- Standardized `AgentContext` and `AgentResult` models
- Built-in thinking trace and tool call recording
- Async-first design for scalability

### 2. **Tool System** (`src/researcher/tools/`)
- Flexible tool interface with timeout and retry handling
- Tool registry for dynamic discovery
- Parallel tool execution support
- Mock search tool for testing

### 3. **Memory System** (`src/researcher/memory/`)
- Persistent storage interface for agent state
- Research plan and intermediate result storage
- Checkpoint support for recovery
- Agent-scoped memory isolation

### 4. **Lead Researcher with Instructor** (`src/researcher/agents/lead_v2.py`)
- Uses Instructor for structured query decomposition
- Creates optimal subagent task specifications
- Manages parallel/sequential execution
- Synthesizes findings using LLM

### 5. **Research Subagent** (`src/researcher/agents/subagent.py`)
- Iterative search with evaluation loops
- Structured search planning using Instructor
- Parallel query execution
- Comprehensive report generation

### 6. **Structured Models** (`src/researcher/agents/models.py`)
- Pydantic models for all LLM interactions:
  - `ResearchDecomposition` - Query analysis and task planning
  - `SubagentTaskSpec` - Detailed task specifications
  - `SearchResultEvaluation` - Result quality assessment
  - `ResearchSynthesis` - Final report structure

## Architecture Highlights

### Query Decomposition with Instructor
```python
# Structured decomposition using Instructor
decomposition = await client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    messages=[...],
    response_model=ResearchDecomposition,
    max_retries=2
)
```

### Parallel Subagent Execution
- Lead agent spawns multiple subagents based on complexity
- Each subagent has independent context and memory
- Results aggregated and synthesized by lead agent

### Token Efficiency
- Subagents compress findings before returning to lead
- Parallel execution maximizes information per token
- Memory prevents redundant searches

## Test Coverage

- **32 unit and integration tests** covering:
  - Agent lifecycle and error handling
  - Tool execution and registry
  - Memory persistence and isolation
  - Multi-agent coordination
  - Instructor integration

## Running the System

```python
# Basic usage
lead = LeadResearcherV2(
    memory=memory,
    tool_registry=registry,
    subagent_class=ResearchSubagent,
    config=config
)

result = await lead.run(context)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Production Tools**: Real web search, API integrations
2. **Citation System**: Map claims to sources
3. **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
4. **State Recovery**: Resume from checkpoints
5. **Evaluation**: LLM-as-judge for quality metrics

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Instructor for Structure**: All LLM outputs use Pydantic models via Instructor
2. **Async Throughout**: Built on asyncio for concurrent operations
3. **Modular Tools**: Easy to add new data sources
4. **Persistent Memory**: Supports long-running research
5. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite from the start

The system demonstrates how Instructor enables reliable multi-agent systems by providing structured, type-safe LLM outputs at every step of the research process.
